# Calculation-of-pressure-drop-in-pipes

You can use pressure drop in pipe calculator for pressure drop and flow rate calculation for all Newtonian fluids (gases and liquids) with constant density (incompressible flow) 
in closed rounded duct. 
Pressure drop calculator is suitable for laminar and turbulent flow regime. You can't use this calculator for compressible gas flow where the pressure of the gas is changing more than 5-10%.
